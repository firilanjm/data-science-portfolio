# Customer Churn Prediction

## Objective
Predict customer churn and identify key factors associated with customer attrition.

## Data
Customer-level dataset including:
- Contract type and tenure
- Service subscriptions
- Billing and payment information
- Churn indicator

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and feature encoding
- Logistic Regression, LASSO Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models
- Model evaluation using cross-validation and ROC-AUC
- Interpretation of coefficients and feature importance

## Key Findings
- Contract type and customer tenure are the strongest predictors of churn
- Logistic regression models provide strong performance with high interpretability
- Random Forest captures nonlinear effects but offers less interpretability

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates applied machine learning, proper model evaluation, and the ability to balance predictive performance with interpretability — essential in business-focused data science roles.

## Tools
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
