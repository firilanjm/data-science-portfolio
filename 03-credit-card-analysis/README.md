# Credit Card Risk Analysis

## Objective
Develop predictive models to assess credit risk and identify factors associated with default behavior.

## Data
Credit card customer data including:
- Demographic characteristics
- Financial and repayment history
- Credit utilization metrics
- Default indicator

## Methods
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Regularized models and tree-based classifiers
- Handling class imbalance
- Model evaluation using ROC-AUC and test-set performance

## Key Findings
- Regularization improves generalization and model stability
- Tree-based models capture complex interactions in credit behavior
- ROC-AUC provides a robust metric for imbalanced classification tasks

## Why This Project Matters
This project highlights advanced modeling techniques and real-world considerations such as class imbalance, making it highly relevant for financial and risk-focused data science internships.

## Tools
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
