# Social Media Addiction and Student Well-Being

## Research Question
How is social media addiction associated with students’ mental health and perceived academic performance?

## Data
Survey data from 700+ students including:
- Addiction score
- Mental health score
- Academic performance perception
- Demographic variables

## Methods
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to analyze mental health outcomes
- Logistic regression to model perceived academic impact
- Statistical inference with hypothesis testing and confidence intervals

## Key Findings
- Higher addiction scores are strongly associated with lower mental health
- Addiction significantly increases the odds of reporting negative academic impact
- Demographic variables have weaker effects once addiction is controlled for

## Why This Project Matters
This project emphasizes statistical reasoning, interpretability, and inference — key skills for data science roles that require explaining results to non-technical stakeholders.

## Tools
Python, pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib
